## About

This add-on wraps the [Paperless Telegram Bot](https://github.com/GeiserX/paperless-telegram-bot) by [GeiserX](https://github.com/GeiserX) into a Home Assistant add-on. It allows you to upload documents to your Paperless-ngx instance simply by sending them to a Telegram bot.

## Configuration

### Required Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | string | Your Telegram Bot API token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) |
| `PAPERLESS_URL` | string | The URL of your Paperless-ngx instance (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000`) |
| `PAPERLESS_TOKEN` | string | Your Paperless-ngx API authentication token |

### Optional Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` | string | *(empty)* | Comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs allowed to use the bot. **If left empty, anyone can use your bot!** |

### Example Configuration

```yaml
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: "1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz"
PAPERLESS_URL: "http://192.168.1.100:8000"
PAPERLESS_TOKEN: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0"
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS: "123456789,987654321"
```


Finding Your Telegram User ID
Open Telegram
Search for @userinfobot
Send any message to the bot
It will reply with your User ID
Enter this ID in the TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS field
For multiple users, separate IDs with commas: "123456789,987654321"


---

## Usage

Once the bot is running, simply interact with it on Telegram:

### Sending Documents

1. Open your Telegram bot chat
2. Send a document or photo
3. The bot will automatically upload it to Paperless-ngx
4. Paperless-ngx will process, OCR, and archive the document

### Supported File Types

| Type | Formats |
|---|---|
| 📄 Documents | PDF |
| 🖼️ Images | JPG, PNG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, WebP |
| 📝 Other | Depends on your Paperless-ngx configuration |

### Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/start` | Start the bot and see welcome message |
| `/help` | Show available commands and usage instructions |

> **Tip:** You can also forward documents from other Telegram chats directly to the bot!
---

## Security

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**

1. **Always set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`** — Without this, anyone who finds your bot can upload documents to your Paperless instance

2. **Keep your tokens secret** — Never share your Telegram Bot Token or Paperless API Token publicly

3. **Use internal network URLs** — If Paperless-ngx runs on the same network, use the local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8000`) instead of exposing it to the internet

4. **Token rotation** — If you suspect a token has been compromised, regenerate it immediately:
   - Telegram: Use `/revoke` in [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
   - Paperless: Regenerate the token in the admin panel
---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't start

**Check the logs** in the Add-on → **Log** tab.

| Error Message | Solution |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is not set` | Make sure you entered the token in the Configuration tab and clicked Save |
| `Connection refused` to Paperless URL | Verify the Paperless URL is correct and reachable from your HA instance |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Your Paperless API token is invalid — regenerate it |
| `Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request` | Another instance of the same bot is running — stop it first |

### Bot is running but doesn't respond

1. Make sure you're messaging the correct bot
2. Check if your user ID is in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` (if configured)
3. Verify the bot token is correct
4. Check the add-on logs for errors

### Documents are uploaded but not appearing in Paperless

1. Check the Paperless-ngx logs for processing errors
2. Verify the API token has sufficient permissions
3. Make sure the file type is supported by your Paperless installation

### Network issues

If your Paperless-ngx instance runs as a Home Assistant add-on or in Docker on the same machine:

```yaml
# Try using the Docker network hostname
PAPERLESS_URL: "http://paperless:8000"

# Or use the host IP
PAPERLESS_URL: "http://192.168.1.100:8000"

# Or use the Docker gateway
PAPERLESS_URL: "http://172.17.0.1:8000"
```

## Technical Details

### File Structure
paperless_telegram_bot/ 

  ├── config.yaml # Add-on configuration and metadata 

  ├── Dockerfile # Docker build instructions 

  ├── run.sh # Startup script (reads HA options → sets env vars) 
  
└── README.md # This file

### How It Works

1. **Home Assistant** stores the add-on configuration in `/data/options.json` inside the container
2. **`run.sh`** reads the options file and exports the values as environment variables
3. The **Paperless Telegram Bot** application reads these environment variables and starts
4. The bot connects to Telegram via **long polling** and waits for incoming messages
5. When a document is received, it's uploaded to Paperless-ngx via the **REST API**
 Telegram │────▶│ HA Add-on │────▶│ Paperless-ngx│ │ (User) │◀────│ (Telegram Bot) │◀────│ (API) │

### Architecture Support

| Architecture | Supported | Typical Devices |
|---|---|---|
| `amd64` | ✅ | Intel/AMD PCs, NUCs, Proxmox VMs |
| `aarch64` | ✅ | Raspberry Pi 4/5 (64-bit), ODROID |
